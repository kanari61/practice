<h3>Professional Summery</h3>
<p>A future media maven who speaks three languages, and has experience in both media and government. My working experience in Shanghai TV Station and at the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has equipped me with attentiveness and carefulness. As a former president of student union, I'm always ready for new challenges. High pressure only impels me to perform better. Quality and efficiency are of equal importance to me. I like turning impossibilities into possibilities.</p>
